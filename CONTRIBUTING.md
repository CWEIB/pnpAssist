You can keep in mind below items when contributing the project or designing a PnPAssist accessory .

- PnPAssist is an open source project so the accessories also must be open source.
- Try to use COTS (commercial off the shelf) products as much as possible.
- COTS parts used in the project should be accessible from anywhere in the world. (like Amazon and Aliexpress)
- Design with 3D printable parts without support as much as possible. If a solution cannot be found, laser cut parts and cnc parts can be used at a minimal level, respectively.
- Publish all design files, bill of materials and other needed documentation so that this design can be implemented by other people in future.
- Design a device you'll be happy to use yourself.
